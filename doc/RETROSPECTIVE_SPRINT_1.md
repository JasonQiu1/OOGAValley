### Spencer Katz

* Work done this Sprint
  I implemented the GameObject class along with its inheritance hierarchy and also made the associated properties classes.
* Plan for next Sprint?
  I would like to finish this and all of the important subclasses of GameObject. However, this is very hard to do without knowing the file configuration

  FileConfiguration and what data will exist is a blocker for most of my work.

  Reflection in StartScreen

* Plan for next Sprint?
  Resource Bundling and Front end tests

* Blockers/Issues in your way
  Completion of most of the View





## Project's current progress

View is able to edit maps, and play the game by placing plants and destroying them, but nothing is connected to the model yet.


## Current level of communication

Current level of communication is not too much because of the midterms and work over the last weekend, but it should be better this sprint.

## Satisfaction with team roles

Team responsibilities could have been better distributed, but everyone was also quite busy this sprint.


## Teamwork that worked well

* Teammates were able to smoothly extend code written by other teammates.

* Teammates took assigned issues being completed by someone else in stride


## Teamwork that could be improved

* More progress completed overall

* More pair programming opportunities


## Teamwork to improve next Sprint

More communication between the model and view as we’re fleshing out the API.
